# Online STEM Courses

This is a  website that compiles free online material for students learning a specific subject. The web page is a template to show what type of features the site would have. The example course is Calculus II, but similar web pages could be designed for other courses. The aim for this website is compile all sorts of resources so that a person studying Calculus II wouldn't have to spend too much of their time searching for lectures, textbooks, practice problems, or projects. 

Apart of lectures, the website also contains applications for the lecture content (The Gini Index, Bernoulli's Principle, etc.). This is to make sure that the students understand why they are learning a certain topic. For example, the Gini Index shows students how they can apply the concept of definite integration. 

In the future, I would like to expand this website to cover other courses as well. For a science subject like biology or chemistry, we would have research papers in place of the applications sections.
